* The PlanetLab boot CD allows you to automatically install this machine as a  *
* node within the PlanetLab overlay network.                                   *
*                                                                              *
* PlanetLab is a global overlay network for developing and accessing new       *
* network services. Our goal is to grow to 1000 geographically distributed     *
* nodes, connected by a diverse collection of links. Toward this end, we are   *
* putting PlanetLab nodes into edge sites, co-location and routing centers,    *
* and homes (i.e., at the end of DSL lines and cable modems). PlanetLab is     *
* designed to support both short-term experiments and long-running services.   *
* Currently running services include network weather maps, network-embedded    *
* storage, peer-to-peer networks, and content distribution networks.           *
*                                                                              *
* Information on joining PlanetLab available at planet-lab.org/consortium/     *
